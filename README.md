## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to their shopping cart

## My process

- Outlined visual for each page using Freeform
- Decided component and file structure
- Created components
- style
- Deploy project

### Built with

# React + Vite

- Javascript
- React

### What I learned

I've learned how to use components to save data and have them intereact with eachother.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div>
  <h1>CV Application</h1>
  <General />
  <Education key="{uuidv4()}" />
  {edStack.map((comp) => comp.src)}
  <button onClick="{onClickAdd}">+</button>
  <button onClick="{onClickDelete}">-</button>
  <Experience />
  {expStack.map((comp) => comp.src)}
  <button onClick="{onClickAddExp}">+</button>
  <button onClick="{onClickDeleteExp}">-</button>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I look forward to conitinuing to apply componets to my sites allowing me to couple of html and js. I'm excited to combine this with my use of the rails framework.
